        history:`Maharana Pratap (1540–1597) was the valiant Rajput king of Mewar, known for his fierce resistance against the Mughal emperor Akbar. Born to Maharana Udai Singh II, he ascended the throne in 1572. He is most famous for the Battle of Haldighati (1576), where his army, though outnumbered, fought bravely against Akbar’s forces led by Man Singh. Despite losing the battle, Maharana Pratap refused to surrender and continued guerrilla warfare, reclaiming most of Mewar, including Kumbhalgarh and Udaipur.

He lived with great hardship, often surviving in forests and caves. His loyal horse, Chetak, played a crucial role in his escape at Haldighati. Unlike other Rajput rulers, he never accepted Mughal rule. Maharana Pratap died in 1597 due to injuries sustained in battle but remains a symbol of Rajput valor and independence. His legacy continues to inspire patriotism in India.`
